			<h3 class="author">AdamElTablawy updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">The revive dead rune has been changed. Now, each sacrifice will 'charge' it. If the number of sacrifice charges is greater than the number of cultists revived by any of the runes, a cultist can be placed on the rune to be revived.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The sacrifice and convert runes have been placed by the 'offer' rune, which fulfills the purpose of both. 2 cultists will convert. 3 cultists will sacrifice a living target. If a target cannot be converted the rune will sacrifice them.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The void torch has been added. This item, attainable through archives, can be used to warp items to other cultists.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The flagellant robes now convey a 50% increase in damage taken instead of a 100% increase in damage taken. They still provide the same speed boost. Which is massive. Use them.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The cult sword can now block incoming projectiles or melee hits, and can be thrown to embed. If this is too powerful it will be changed or reverted accordingly.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Veil shifter now has 4 charges, up from 2.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">All constructs except for the wraith are about the same speed as a human, or slower. The artificer in particular is slower. Wraiths are far more fragile than before. Harvesters, spawned by nar'sie, are much much much stronger.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">As usual, if you have any questions or complaints ping me and i'll respond.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">The ash drake blood potion has been nerfed. Again. Also, all of the other ash drake drops are removed.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">More alien simplemob fixes.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">You can't get holoparasites from fucking xenobiology anymore (what)</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">ShadowDeath6 updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscdel">Blood and clockwork cultists can no longer scribe runes or create structures off of the station's z level.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Tinkerer's cache turns itself off when leaving the zlevel or being in space. It has a new icon to indicate when this happens.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixes invisible judicial visor icons. Wait, that was SUPPOSED to be visible?</li>
